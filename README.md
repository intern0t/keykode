# Project KeyKode.

> KeyKode is tiny project which makes use of built-in Javascript libraries and in addition, Clipboard.JS to encode a URL using Base64 and creates a shareable link which is decoded clientside. 

View the live [Demo](https://intern0t.github.io/keykode/) here.

#### Pros

2. No server required
3. No metadata stored
4. All client-sided.
5. Uses hashbang to handle URL parameter (encoded Base64).
